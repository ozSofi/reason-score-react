# Reason Score - in React
A public super fact checking process.
Lost facts limit us. If we can increase our common facts by even a small percentage human kind could accellerate exponentially. Reason Score is a process where all _your_ facts are heard and you understand all _their_ facts so _we_ can act together.

1. Limited set of libraries
1. Abstraced data management so it can be hooked up to multiple types of backends
1. Flexible data model so different front ends and features can be prototyped quickly
1. Visual look can be easily changed to match host website.
1. Users should be able to embed the HTML into their sites as a static HTML. They should also be able to activate it with Javascript if they want to.
